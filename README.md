# SimpleWorkOrderPlatform
A simple platform for customer &amp; work order management.

This project is based on `Vue.js`, `Mongodb` and `Node.js`. If you are new to these things, this project would be a simple enough example for you to get going.

## How to deploy ##

1. Clone this repo, go to root path. Use `npm install` to install server-side libraries.

2. Go to `/front-end` folder, which contains all front-end code created by vue-cli. Use `npm install` again.

3. Stay in `/front-end`, use `npm run build` to build the page. You will find the built page in the `dist` folder. Or you can `npm run dev` to jump into building your own pages.

4. Go back to project root path, use `npm start` to init server. Then you are good to go!
